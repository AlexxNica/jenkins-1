# Jenkins
This repository is used to store the Jenkins based CI configuration files - both for backup, re-creation and history.

## Details
In case someone would like to reproduce the Clear Containers Jenkins CI, he could rely onto this repo to have all the
configurations already setup. Of course, this won't work directly, since it requires to provide credentials and proper
accounts to make this work.

The basic idea here is to make sure that our CI configuration can be shared across different projects.
